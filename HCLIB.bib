Travel demand theory, strongly influenced by econometrics, has developed largely independently of microeconomic theory and ignores consumption decisions. I treat consumption and travel in a unified manner for consumers allocating their time between wage-earning and discretionary trips to purchase a variety of consumption goods. The focus is the complementariness and substitution between travel and consumption. The consumer decides the frequency of the trips to make to each store over a period of time and how much to buy on each trip. I also examine how the consumer should mix separate trips to two stores, with chained trips in which he visits both stores. Under the preferences specified, resources saved by trip-chaining go into more travel so that the total expenditure allocated to travel remains unchanged. I point out how the model can be generalized in a number of ways to improve its scope and applicability."

Road pricing is widely promoted as a tool to reduce these externalities. Based on a review of theory as well as experience with existing schemes, this article draws four conclusions about urban road pricing: (1) the benefits of road pricing exceed the costs; (2) the benefits of congestion relief are larger than the benefits of improvements in environmental quality; (3) success depends in part, but only to a limited extent, on the presence of public transit and on how service is adjusted; and (4) the distributional effects and public acceptance of road pricing pose important challenges for policy design.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT Personal travel time in U.S. urban areas has been stable, clashing with the assertion that urban sprawl greatly lengthens travel. Average commute time rises by 7.7 percent with each cross-sectional doubling of Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) jobs. Using the RELU-TRAN structural computable general equilibrium model of the Chicago MSA, we simulate the equilibrium effects of a 24 percent population increase projected from 2000 to 2030 by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. If no new road capacity is added, then congestion per mile increases. Although the urbanized land area increases by 19 percent, indicating sprawl, the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per car-trip decreases by 1.31 percent and the VMT per car-trip to work decreases by 2.78 percent. Car travel time increases by only 6.25 percent and commuting time by only 4.54 percent, from 30.3 minutes in 2000 to 31.7 in 2030 or 3.4 seconds per year. We further explore the effects of new road capacity, gasoline prices, public transit speed, fuel economy gains, limits on suburban construction, and importantly, the cross-elasticity of public transit use with respect to car times. The availability of public transportation, economizing on nonwork travel, and land use adjustments that increase job-residence proximity keep times stable.},

We consider 347 estimates of density elasticities of a broad range of outcomes ranging from wages, innovation, rents, various amenities, the cost of providing public services, transport- and environment-related outcomes to health and wellbeing. More than 100 of these estimates have not been previously published and have been provided by authors on request or inferred from published results in auxiliary analyses. We contribute original estimates of density elasticities of 16 distinct outcome variables that belong to categories where the evidence base is thin, inconsistent or non-existent. Along with a critical discussion of the quality and the quantity of the evidence base we present a set of recommended elasticities. Applying them to a scenario that roughly corresponds to an average high-income city, we find that density seems to be a net-amenity that is associated with positive external welfare effects. Densification policies may be welfare enhancing, but the distributional effects may be regressive, especially if residents are immobile and housing supply is inelastic.}

The aggregate benefit of pricing LA County road congestion increases 2.7 fold when the toll revenue is recycled to cut the income tax of the poorer LA County workers while maintaining region-wide tax revenue neutrality. Consumers get 66% of the aggregate benefit and landlords 41%, while importers suffer losses equal to 7% of the aggregate benefit. Gross regional product increases by 1.34%. The aggregate benefit changes negligibly when the toll revenue is recycled to cut sales taxes instead of the income tax, but gross product still rises by 0.6%. Under the sales tax cut, consumers, importers and landlords benefit more evenly than under the income tax cut, but with the property tax cut nearly all of the cut is capitalized into property values."

We incorporate traffic congestion into a quantitative general equilibrium spatial framework and apply it to evaluate the welfare impact of transportation infrastructure improvements. Our approach yields analytical expressions for transportation costs between any two locations, the traffic along each link of the transportation network, and the equilibrium distribution of economic activity across the economy, each as a function of the underlying quality of infrastructure and the strength of traffic congestion. We characterize the properties of such an equilibrium and show how the framework can be combined with traffic data to evaluate the impact of improving any segment of the infrastructure network. Applying our framework to both the U.S. highway network and the Seattle road network, we find highly variable returns to investment across different links in the respective transportation networks, highlighting the importance of well-targeted infrastructure investment.},

 abstract = {I present in this paper the skeleton of a theory of marriage. The two basic assumptions are that each person tries to do as well as possible and that the "marriage market" is in equilibrium. With the aid of several additional simplifying assumptions, I derive a number of significant implications about behavior in this market. For example, the gain to a man and woman from marrying compared to remaining single is shown to depend positively on their incomes, human capital, and relative difference in wage rates. The theory also implies that men differing in physical capital, education or intelligence (aside from their effects on wage rates), height, race, or many other traits will tend to marry women with like values of these traits, whereas the correlation between mates for wage rates or for traits of men and women that are close substitutes in household production will tend to be negative. The theory does not take the division of output between mates as given, but rather derives it from the nature of the marriage market equilibrium. The division is determined here, as in other markets, by marginal productivities, and these are affected by the human and physical capital of different persons, sex ratios (that is, the relative numbers of men and women), and some other variables.},

 abstract = {This paper provides sequential labor supply estimates for French married men and women under specifications analogous to those used by Hausman to account for the effects of taxation upon the budget constraint. Results suggest that, even though labor force participation follows the expected pattern, work hours are quite rigid, most of the variation in the latter being attributed to measurement errors. The second part of the paper concentrates on the simultaneous estimation of male and female labor supply. Conditional maximum likelihood techniques are shown to permit the separate estimation of work hours for both spouses with an appropriate set of instruments aimed at correcting for the biases arising from simultaneity, selectivity, and the nonlinearity of the budget constraint. Although consistent, the resulting estimates apparently contradict the usual rationality restrictions on family labor supply behavior and seem to confirm the lack of flexibility in work hours.},

The discussion begins with a look at recent policy reforms and labor market facts that motivate the study of labor supply. The analysis then presents a unifying framework that allows alternative empirical formulations of the labor supply model to be compared and their resulting elasticities to be interpreted. This is followed by critical reviews of alternative approaches to labor-supply modeling. The first review assesses the difference-in-differences approach and its relationship to natural experiments. The second analyzes estimation with non-linear budget constraints and welfare-program participation. The third appraises developments of family labor-supply models including both the standard unitary and collective labor-supply formulations. The fourth briefly explores dynamic extensions of the labor supply model, characterizing how participation decisions, learning-by-doing, human capital accumulation and habit formation affect the analysis of the lifecycle model. At the end of each of the four broad reviews, we summarize a selection of the recent empirical findings. The concluding section asks whether the developments reviewed in this chapter place us in a better position to answer the policy-reform questions and to interpret the trends in participation and hours with which we began this review. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Apart from being origin-based, the algorithm is different from other algorithms used so far for the traffic assignment problem by its restriction to acyclic solutions and by the use of approach proportions as solution variables. Projected quasi-Newton search directions are used to shift flows effectively and to eliminate residual flows. Experimental results comparing the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-practice algorithm of Frank and Wolfe demonstrate the algorithm's excellent convergence performance, especially when highly accurate solutions are needed. Reasonable memory requirements make this algorithm applicable to large-scale networks. The resulting solution has an immediate route flow interpretation, thus providing equivalent detail to route-based solutions.},

The paper develops a simple dynamic model in which new suburban and older central-city properties compete for mobile residents. The level of housing services generated by older properties depends on current maintenance or reinvestment expenditures. In this setting, market failures that reduce the cost of occupying suburban locations, thus leading to excessive suburban development, also depress central-city housing prices and undermine maintenance incentives, leading to deficient levels of central-city reinvestment. Corrective policies that shift population from the suburbs to the center result in higher levels of reinvestment in central-city housing, therefore reducing blight."

Nonetheless, economists also recognize the production advantages of urban density in the form of positive agglomeration externalities. The long-run equilibrium outcomes in economies with multiple correlated but offsetting externalities have yet to be fully explored in the literature. Therefore, I develop a spatial equilibrium model of urban structure that includes both congestion costs and agglomeration externalities. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using a computational algorithm to match the spatial distribution of employment, population, land use, land rents, and commute times in the data. Policy simulations based on the estimates suggest that congestion pricing may have ambiguous consequences for economic welfare.}

Each radial railroad reduces central city industrial GDP by about 20\%, with ring roads displacing an additional 50\%. We provide evidence that radial highways decentralize service sector activity, radial railroads decentralize industrial activity, and ring roads decentralize both.

The analysis considers three different regimes for provision of parking space: surface parking, underground parking, and structural parking, with the latter two regimes involving capital investment either in the form of an underground parking garage or an above-ground parking structure. Parking area is viewed as a dwelling attribute that, along with floor space, provides utility. In addition, road congestion in the neighborhood (which affects the commuting costs of local residents) depends on the average amount of off-street parking per dwelling, an externality that is ignored by profit-maximizing developers, making the equilibrium inefficient. The analysis explores the equilibrium spatial behavior of the two dwelling attributes as well as residential and parking structural density, and analysis of land rent shows which parking regimes are present in different parts of the city. Efficiency requires an increase in parking area per dwelling at each location, which can be achieved in a crude fashion by an MPR, whose effects are analyzed.}",

abstract = "This paper constructs a theoretical model that facilitates analysis of the effects of employer-paid parking on mode choice, road investment and suburbanization. The model simplifies urban space by dividing it into two zones (islands), center and suburbs, which are connected by a congested road and a public-transit line. Each road commuter requires an allotment of CBD land for parking, and because the central zone’s area is fixed, parking land reduces the amount available for central residences and CBD production. The model characterizes optimal resource allocation from the perspective of a social planner. The planning solution can be decentralized, which requires employee- rather than employer-paid parking, congestion tolls, and a tax (subsidy) to offset the road capacity deficit (surplus). The analysis then considers the effect of switching to employer-paid parking, with the burden of parking costs shifting from road users to employers, thus reducing the wage for all workers. This switch inefficiently increases road usage and capacity investment, while spurring an inefficient increase in suburbanization."

Both models lead to a relation between county employment density and productivity at the state level. Using data on gross state output we find that a doubling of employment density increases average labor productivity by around 6 percent. More than half of the variance of output per worker across states can be explained by differences in the density of economic activity.},

Firstly, we develop a general equilibrium model to explore the impact of a small budgetary-neutral investment in transport infrastructure in a second-best setting, where other markets in the economy are distorted by taxes or external costs. The model incorporates different transport modes that are used both for intermediate inputs (freight) and for final consumption (passenger travel). An intuitive operational expression for the net economic benefit of an investment is derived that depends on the way the investment is financed. This expression generalizes recent findings in the literature. Secondly, we illustrate the results numerically using a small example. Our findings show that both the specific financing instrument used and the labour market consequences may have large implications for the net benefits of transport investments. Significant errors may be made in limiting cost-benefit analysis to transport markets only."

The most important concerns are about endogeneity at the local and individual levels, the choice of a productivity measure between wages and total-factor productivity, and the roles of spatial scale, firms’ characteristics, and functional forms. Estimated impacts of local determinants of productivity, employment, and firms’ location choices are surveyed for both developed and developing economies. We finally provide a discussion of attempts to identify and quantify specific agglomeration mechanisms.}

The major consideration is the trade-off between economies of scale in production in the central business district and the diseconomies of congestion in commuter transport. Planned optimum allocations and their decentralized implementation by suitable taxes and transfers are discussed. Rent and density profiles and land use are solved in closed form, and complete numerical solutions are obtained for particular parameter values. It is shown that negative exponential rent and density profiles may not be very good approximations, and that cities of more than a million inhabitants are difficult to justify in the framework considered.},

First, the concept of stochastic-user-equilibration (S-U-E) is formalized as an extension of Wardrop's user-equilibration criterion. Then, the stochastic-network-loading (S-N-L) problem (a special case of S-U-E for networks with constant link costs) is analyzed in detail and an expression for the probability of route choice which is based on two general postulates of user behavior is derived. The paper also discusses the weaknesses of existing S-N-L techniques (with special attention paid to Dial's multipath method) and compares them to the suggested approach. The proposed model seems reasonable and does not exhibit the inherent weaknesses of the logit model when applied to sets of routes which overlap heavily. The discussion is supported by several numerical examples on small contrived networks. The paper concludes with the discussion of two techniques that can be used to approximate the link flows resulting from the proposed model in large networks.},

Externalities appear to be substantial in traffic‐dense states: in California, for example, we find that the increase in traffic density from a typical additional driver increases total statewide insurance costs of other drivers by \$1,725–\$3,239 per year, depending on the model. High–traffic density states have large economically and statistically significant externalities in all specifications we check. In contrast, the accident externality per driver in low‐traffic states appears quite small. On balance, accident externalities are so large that a correcting Pigouvian tax could raise \$66 billion annually in California alone, more than all existing California state taxes during our study period, and over \$220 billion per year nationally. }

We formulate and analyze a rich spatial model that allows for spillovers, matching and income tax, in a setting with multiple work and residential locations and very general worker heterogeneity. The conventional consumer surplus captures part of the benefits and is calculated based on predictions of changes in travel demand and transport costs. The issue is to determine which so-called wider impacts to add to this. We find that adding the change in total output as a wider impact leads to double-counting of benefits. The output change due to spillovers should be added, while the output change due to matching is already partly included in the consumer surplus. These results are useful for applied cost-benefit analysis of transport policies."

 abstract = {Recent theories of economic growth, including those of Romer, Porter, and Jacobs, have stressed the role of technological spillovers in generating growth. Because such knowledge spillovers are particularly effective in cities, where communication between people is more extensive, data on the growth of industries in different cities allow us to test some of these theories. Using a new data set on the growth of large industries in 170 U.S. cities between 1956 and 1987, we find that local competition and urban variety, but not regional specialization, encourage employment growth in industries. The evidence suggests that important knowledge spillovers might occur between rather than within industries, consistent with the theories of Jacobs.},

abstract = {While significant progress has occurred in quantifying congestion costs within the sphere of traffic engineering, little progress has been made to incorporate such costs into network-level highway evaluation systems. The model presented in this paper takes a middle ground approach between the highly detailed microsimulation approach that is most appealing to the traffic engineer and the traditional highway development engineers’ approach of ignoring traffic congestion. The approach adopted is based on modeling of acceleration noise, defined as the standard deviation of accelerations. During periods of high traffic congestion, there is a greater variability in speed, resulting in higher acceleration noise levels. Data collection and analysis have been undertaken on highways in Auckland (New Zealand), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and Bangkok (Thailand). This updated approach (relative to the original HDM-4 research in 1995) has been integrated with the International Study of Highway Development and Management Tools  in order to provide an updated model HDM-4 (Highway Development and Management version 4). Fuel consumption predictions were tested both with and without the impact of a simulated acceleration noise level. For the latter of the two (i.e., a given drive cycle) the predictions were within 0.25\%. For a generated drive cycle, the results show a consistent underprediction of some 25\%. It is believed that this underprediction is largely due to the assumption of the acceleration noise data conforming to a normal distribution. While not prescribed in detail within this paper, vehicle emission models were also developed as part of the work with the results of tests presented. Vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons were within the range of the seven vehicles observed. Carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen were grossly underpredicted and were below the minimum observed values. These latter results are thought to be caused by the fuel model not predicting rich operating conditions during periods of high acceleration. The model presented, even with the preceding limitations, still has wide application in improving the prediction of vehicles operating on highways in congested conditions. In particular, the model presented provides a much improved predictive ability over those of traditional speed-flow approaches, where errors as high as 200\% for passenger cars (higher for trucks) are observed. This makes the approach highly appropriate for inclusion into highway evaluation procedures such as HDM-4. The patterns of fuel consumption and emissions show the appropriate changes in relation to traffic congestion. Furthermore, the model framework readily lends itself to enhancement via adoption of new submodels.}

A generalised translog production-inverse input demand function is estimated to test for the existence of variable returns to agglomeration in manufacturing, construction and service industries. Two separate measures of urban density, in which proximity is represented by straight line distance or by generalised cost, are constructed and included in the translog to identify the effect of road traffic congestion. The results show that for some sectors of the economy diminishing returns to urban density can set in causing the magnitude of agglomeration elasticity to fall as effective densities increase. The generalised cost based measure of agglomeration produces higher elasticities because it captures both time and distance dimensions of density. A comparison of spatial variance in estimates indicates that road traffic congestion plays an important role in explaining diminishing returns for the most highly urbanised locations."

Winning and losing counties have similar trends in TFP prior to the new plant opening. Five years after the opening, incumbent plants' TFP is 12 percent higher in winning counties. This productivity spillover is larger for plants sharing similar labor and technology pools with the new plant. Consistent with spatial equilibrium models, labor costs increase in winning counties, indicating that profits ultimately increase less than productivity.}

Exposure to transport improvements is measured through changes in accessibility, calculated at a detailed geographical scale from changes in minimum journey times along the road network. These changes are induced by the construction of new road link schemes. We deal with the potential endogeneity of scheme location by identifying the effects of changes in accessibility from variation across small-scale geographical areas close to the scheme. We find substantial positive effects on area level employment and number of establishments. For existing establishments we find increases in output per worker, wages and use of intermediate inputs. A plausible interpretation is that new transport infrastructure attracts transport intensive establishments to an area, and also leads to some reorganization of production in existing businesses."

 abstract = {There is an extensive literature on the urbanization process looking at both urbanization and urban concentration, asking whether and when there is under or over-urbanization or under or over urban concentration. Writers argue that national government policies and non-democratic institutions promote excessive concentration--the extent to which the urban population of a country is concentrated in one or two major metropolitan areas--except in former planned economies where migration restrictions are enforced. These literatures assume that there is an optimal level of urbanization or an optimal level of urban concentration, but no research to date has quantitatively examined the assumption and asked the basic "so-what" question--how great are the economic losses from significant deviations from any optimal degrees of urban concentration or rates of urbanization? This paper shows that (1) there is a best degree of urban concentration, in terms of maximizing productivity growth (2) that best degree varies with the level of development and country size, and (3) over or under-concentration can be very costly in terms of productivity growth. The paper shows also that productivity growth is not strongly affected by urbanization per se. Rapid urbanization has often occurred in the face of low or negative economic growth over some decades. Moreover, urbanization is a transitory phenomenon where many countries are now fully urbanized.},

abstract = {Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.}}

The results suggest optimal peak user tolls of 2-7 cents per automobile mile on rural highways, 2-9 cents on suburban highways, and 6-35 cents on central city highways. Although our results are to some degree dependent on the interest rate, time value, and peak demand configuration assumed, one basic conclusion holds up under all alternative assumptions: current user charges are well below optimal peak tolls. However, our results also suggest considerably higher rush-hour speeds than currently prevail on Bay Area roads, and the lower travel time costs suggested by our analysis (relative to the current situation) should to some degree offset the corresponding higher user charges.}

abstract = "The own-wage elasticity of labor demand is a key parameter in empirical research and policy analysis. However, despite extensive research, estimates of labor demand elasticities are subject to considerable heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore various dimensions of this heterogeneity by means of a comprehensive meta-regression analysis, building on information from 151 different studies containing 1334 estimates in total. Our results show that heterogeneity in the estimates of the elasticity is natural to a considerable extent: the magnitude of the elasticity depends on the theoretical model applied and features of the workforce. Moreover, we find that labor demand has become more elastic over time, and is particularly elastic in countries with low levels of employment protection legislation. Furthermore, we find heterogeneity due to the empirical specification of the labor demand model, characteristics of the dataset and publication bias."

abstract = { Executive SummaryMore stringent fuel-economy standards and increased popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) are contributing to an erosion in federal motor vehicle fuel excise tax revenues. One solution to this problem is a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax. I consider the distributional implications of a federal tax swap where a VMT tax is used to finance a reduction in the federal excise tax on gasoline. The distributional impact of this tax swap depends on the sign of the income elasticity of demand for fuel intensity.Using data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, I find that the income elasticity of fuel intensity is negative and that this revenue-neutral tax swap is mildly progressive for all household incomes below \$200,000. How the progressivity of a tax swap changes as fuel-economy standards are raised and EV market penetration increases depends on who purchases EVs and more efficient vehicles. I demonstrate how federal policy will likely influence those who buy EVs and the ultimate distribution of the tax swap. In addition, I find the tax swap benefits rural drivers and has no appreciable differential impacts on Black and Hispanic households. }

The paper takes a geographic approach, and focuses on the attenuation of agglomeration and human capital effects. Differencing and instrumental variable methods are employed to address endogeneity in the wage–agglomeration relationship and also to deal with measurement error in our agglomeration and human capital variables. Three key results are obtained. First, the spatial concentration of employment within five miles is positively related to wage. Second, the benefits of spatial concentration are driven by proximity to college educated workers, an instance of human capital spillovers. Third, these effects attenuate sharply with distance.}

This paper considers the empirical literature on the nature and sources of urban increasing returns, also known as agglomeration economies. An important aspect of these externalities that has not been previously emphasized is that the effects of agglomeration extend over at least three different dimensions. These are the industrial, geographic, and temporal scope of economic agglomeration economies. In each case, the literature suggests that agglomeration economies attenuate with distance. Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all contribute to agglomeration.}

Until the past decade, the theoretical literature on economic geography had focused on stylized settings that could not easily be taken to the data. This article reviews more recent research that has developed quantitative models of economic geography. These models are rich enough to speak to first-order features of the data, such as many heterogeneous locations and gravity equation relationships for trade and commuting. At the same time, these models are sufficiently tractable to undertake realistic counterfactual exercises to study the effect of changes in amenities, productivity, and public policy interventions such as transport infrastructure investments. We provide an extensive taxonomy of the different building blocks of these quantitative spatial models and discuss their main properties and quantification.}

Research has revealed many regularities and connections between willingness to pay for time savings and other economic factors including time of day choice, aversion to unreliability, labor supply, taxation, activity scheduling, intra-household time allocation, and out-of-office productivity. Some of these connections have been addressed through sophisticated modeling, revealing a plethora of reasons for heterogeneity in value of time rooted in behavior at a micro scale. This paper reviews what we know and what we need to know. A recurrent theme is that the value of time for a particular travel movement depends strongly on very specific factors, and that understanding how these factors work will provide new insights into travel behavior and into more general economic choices."

keywords = "Speed choice, Speed limit, Fuel tax, Revenue recycling, Speed externalities, Time saving bias",
abstract = "Speed externalities – the impacts that a driver’s speed choice imposes on others – are usually quoted to justify highway speed regulation in the form of maximum speed limits. However, speed externalities could already be internalized if a pre-existing policy were in place that is related to speed, questioning the traditional rationale supporting speed limits. Given the relationship between speed and fuel consumption and the omnipresence of fuel taxes around the world, it comes as a surprise that pre-existing taxes on motor fuel are completely missing in the debate on the general appropriateness of speed regulation. In this paper we develop an economic equilibrium model of highway speed choice accounting for (i) a market failure – speeding externalities capturing the fact that drivers do not internalize the adverse consequences of speeding on other highway users and the society as a whole; (ii) a famous speed related behavioral anomaly – causing adverse effects drivers impose on themselves by falsely predicting the time saving potential of speed; (iii) a pre-existing fuel tax – closing the wedge between the privately and socially optimal speed. The latter creates a ‘government feedback effect’ reflecting the positive feedback effect of speed on fuel tax revenue and so the broader beneficial fiscal impacts of speed choice ignored by drivers. Numerical computations for Germany indicate a dominant ‘government feedback effect’ ((iii) outweighs (i)) for mean speeds up to around 120 km/h presuming fully variable travel time budgets and beyond that speed level when drivers put (some of the) travel time savings from speeding into more highway traveling. This implies that speed externalities are largely internalized and that the externality rationale in favor of speed regulation does not apply to the majority of drivers. Nevertheless, a moderate speed limit on German highways of 130 km/h would probably not compromise economic efficiency, at least as long as the share of diesel cars is significant. Generally, when drivers are subject to lack of rationality leading to excess speeding, (iii) is not able to outweigh (i). Then, speed limits remain highly warranted provided that appropriate “nudging” is not available. The numerical finding is likely to hold for a large number of European countries too but probably not for North American countries where fuel taxes are considerably lower."

 abstract = {There is a substantial empirical literature quantifying the positive relationship between city size and productivity. This paper studies the implications of that relationship for evaluations of urban transport improvements. A theoretical model is developed and used to derive a cost--benefit measure that includes the impact of transport improvements on city size and hence on the productivity of new and existing city workers. The size of such effects is illustrated in a simple computable equilibrium model. It is argued that these productivity effects, particularly when combined with distortionary taxation, are quantitatively important, substantially increasing the gains attributable to urban transport improvements.},

The second-best tax rule for this problem is derived for general static networks, so that the solution presented is valid for any graph of the network and any set of tolling points available. A number of known second-best tax rules are shown to be special cases of the general solution presented. It is further demonstrated that, for instance by using the concept of ‘virtual links’, the same method can be applied to a broader class of second-best problems in static networks. Finally, a small network is used to demonstrate numerically that an interior second-best optimum need not always be unique, and need not always exist. However, both examples require extreme differences in marginal external costs across links, and a non-optimal toll-point to be used, which casts doubt on the practical relevance of this complication."

An algorithm is presented for finding second-best tolls, based on this general solution. A simulation model is used for studying its performance for various archetype pricing schemes: a toll-cordon, area licences, parking policies in the city centre, pricing of a single major highway, and pay-lanes and `free-lanes' on major highways. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis is given of a method for selecting the optimal location of toll points when not all links can be tolled."

We account for endogeneity of distance by using employer-induced changes in distance. In Germany, distance has a slight positive effect on daily and weekly labour supply, but no effect on the number of workdays. The effect of distance on labour supply patterns is stronger for female workers, but it is still small."

We show that the external cost – even when roads are not hypercongested – is substantial, equaling about two thirds of the private (time) cost of travel. About one third of this cost is borne by public transport users. Most roads are never hypercongested, but some are hypercongested for more than one hour per day. Hypercongestion accounts for about 40 percent of congestion-related welfare losses. Welfare losses incurred on roads that are hypercongested are substantial, predominantly because of a reduction in speed rather than throughput. Our results suggest policies that reduce congestion can result in important welfare gains.",

First, it is demonstrated that a solution to the Herbert-Stevens model does not meet well-established criteria for an equilibrium. Secondly, a new linear programming model is suggested which is proven to achieve equilibrium if certain conditions are met. An iterative procedure for meeting these conditions is suggested, and an operational version of the model exhibits no problem in obtaining convergence. The revised model represents a feasible way of simulating urban land markets.}
